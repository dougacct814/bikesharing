## Data Analytics
Proposed Question to Analyze:  What is the gender diversity of Des Moines? How does it compare to the gender diversity of New York City? What effect does it have on possible business in Des Moines?
### Results Summary
Overall, when examining the trip data for New York City, the vast majority of riders were male.  The Male or Unknown gender comprised of over 75% of the entire riders.  This data point stood out and we wanted to dive further into Des Moines to determine and compare the gender analytics.  We downloaded the census data for both cities and completed the story board referenced below.  

While New York City has a much larger population, their female gender percentage was 2% higher than the City of Des Moines.  With the analytics of the rider data, we feel confident that the larger percentage of males in Des Moines would lead to an increase in riders proportionality.

### Statistical Results
Des Moines Gender Diversity (percentage):  
 - Male: 49%
 - Female: 51%
 
 Des Moines Gender compared to New York City
 - New York City has a higher female gender ratio with 52%
 
 Effect:  Male riders were much higher in the citi bike ride data, and with Des Moines projecting a 2% increase in Male gender, it could lead to an increase in rider percentage.
